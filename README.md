# MatchaTone — An Interactive Voice-Responsive Companion

MatchaTone is a soft and emotive character that reacts to sound and touch.  
Designed as a calming companion, it listens closely when you whisper, becomes shy when surprised, and gently falls asleep when the world grows quiet. MatchaTone blends character animation, ambient audio, and microphone-based interaction into a small emotional experience.

### ✧ Core Idea
MatchaTone explores how digital characters can feel alive through subtle behaviors.  
Instead of buttons, menus, or commands, the character is shaped by natural input — your voice, your presence, and your touch.

### ✧ Interaction
**Sound Input**
- Soft sound → MatchaTone leans in to listen  
- Loud sound → MatchaTone becomes shy  
- Silence (10s) → MatchaTone falls asleep  
- Normal sound → Remains awake in the Live state  

**Touch Input**
- Tap → MatchaTone responds with a joyful Happy animation  

### ✧ Behaviors
- **Live** — normal idle with subtle motion  
- **Listening** — approaches and listens closely  
- **Happy** — reacts with joy and plays a soft looping melody  
- **Shy** — startled by loud sound  
- **Sleep** — falls asleep after long quiet, with its own sleep BGM  

### ✧ Technology
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using video-driven animations and microphone analysis.  
Custom audio system enables cross-faded background music and embedded sound effects.
